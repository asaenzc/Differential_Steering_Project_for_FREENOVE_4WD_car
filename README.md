# Differential_Steering_Project_for_FREENOVE_4WD_car
4WD-Freenove_car (Differential_Steering project)
Project on "How to handle the steering of the car" with wheels that can't turn? Electronically controlling the speed of the 4 wheels independently.
Without stepping on the accelerator and moving the steering wheel, the car turns on itself. When you press the accelerator the car moves forward turning if you move the steering wheel.
